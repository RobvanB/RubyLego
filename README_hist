=======================
* Had problems with gems (again) - Removed RVM, and uninstalled all ruby packages using the Ubuntu package installer
* Reinstalled rvm and used rvm to install Ruby
* Installed all gems using the RubyMine gem installer (serialport, libusb, ruby-usb)
* Autodetect_usb.rb was populating the DEV variable even when no (serial) device was found. Fixed that, this also made
  the USB detection/connection work in nxt_comm.rb
* A string comparison in nxt_comm.rb didn't work - I think because of Ruby 1.9.3 - fixed
* created a "test" class for "lego_nxt" and one for "ruby-nxt"

=====================
Ruby installed with rvm
Gems installed from RubyMine (File -> Settings)  AND from command line

Links used:
usb: (gem libusb and ruby-usb)  http://thingylab.com/wiki/ruby_example_with_ruby-usb

nxt: (gem ruby-nxt)             http://ruby-nxt.rubyforge.org/

Also:
lego_nxt         "http://github.com/docwhat/lego_nxt"

lego-nxt says to use ruby-serialport, but that one won't install on Ruby 1.9.3, so use 'serialport'.
See http://erik.debill.org/2010/02/07/ruby-serialport-ruby-1-9-1 - very bottom of article

I had to modify
/home/rob/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@global/gems/ruby-nxt-0.8.1/lib/nxt.rb
because the file had 2 lines that 'require' the light and ultrasonic sensor, but the
paths were wrong

The 'gem' statements at the top of the class are required in order to avoid the 'cannot load file' error
and have the intelisense work - this is likely also related to the fact that the gems need to be
installed twice (via RM and via command line) and the 2 ruby paths:
/home/rob/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@global/gems/
and
/home/rob/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/
Pretty sure this is RVM related

The line "gem 'libusb'" is commented out because libusb is loaded by lego_nxt, and the versions collide

LEGO_NXT is used to setup the usb connection to the brick

The plan is to use ruby-nxt to send the commands



Ignore text below:
I modified the gemspec for lego_nxt because of this error:
Unable to activate lego_nxt-0.0.2, because libusb-0.2.0 conflicts with libusb (~> 0.1.3) (Gem::LoadError)
I commented out the dependency on libusb in the gemspec
/home/rob/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@global/gems/lego_nxt-0.0.2/lego_nxt.gemspec
/home/rob/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/lego_nxt-0.0.2/lego_nxt.gemspec
